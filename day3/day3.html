<p>Farmers are often members of local, regional, or national farmers' unions or agricultural producers' organizations and can exert significant political influence. The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry" title="grange" target="blank"> Grange movement</a> in the United States was effective in advancing farmers' agendas, especially against railroad and agribusiness interests early in the 20th century. The FNSEA is very politically active in France, especially pertaining to genetically modified food. Agricultural producers, both small and large, are represented globally by the International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP), representing over 600 million farmers through 120 national farmers' unions in 79 countries</p>
